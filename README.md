# Dice_Challenge
Dice Challenge is a simple web app where two players roll virtual dice on each page refresh. Each dice shows a random number from 0 to 6. The winner is declared based on who rolls a higher number, or it shows "Draw" if both are equal. Built using JavaScript's 'Math.random()' and 'querySelectorAll()' for DOM manipulation. Refresh to play!
